This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been properly initialized or assigned a value.  It's especially common when dealing with asynchronous operations or conditional rendering within functional components.  For example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('some_api_endpoint')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.someProperty}</Text> {/* Error here if data is still null */}
    </View>
  );
};
```

In this example, `data` will be `null` initially.  Accessing `data.someProperty` before the `fetch` request completes will throw an error because you're trying to access a property of `null`.
